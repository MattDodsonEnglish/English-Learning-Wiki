# The Slavic Smile))

Here's a conversation I once had with a Russian friend:

```markdown
Russian: Thanks)
Matt: NP. Also, not sure if you know, but the smiley at the end of this sentence will not be
recognized as a smiley by the average European/American)
Russian: :scream:
```

What I said is true. The smiley at the end of this sentence is like a Slavic fingerprint upon a text)). If someone uses it, it's nearly certain they're Russian, Belorussian, Ukrainian, Kazakh et cetera. If they aren't, then, at least, they're someone who wants to imitate Slavic communication.

If readers don't know about the Slav smile, it'll just make them start searching for the beginning of a parenthesis that doesn't exist. This is unfortunate--the happiness you wish to communicate ends in only confusion. I know, it happened to me.

I think I heard the Slav smile exists because the colon is inconvenient to type on a Cyrillic keyboard. That idea's supported by [this thread on stack exchange](https://russian.stackexchange.com/questions/13142/what-do-or-multiple-mean-in-an-internet-conversation), and I won't look into it any more than that.

I'm sure Slavs have many fine reasons to use the Slavic smile,  but it doesn't make it any less confusing to the rest of us((
