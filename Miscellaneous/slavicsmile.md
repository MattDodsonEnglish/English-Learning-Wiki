# The Slavic Smile))

Here's a conversation I once had with a Russian friend:

```markdown
Russian: Thanks)
Matt: NP. Also, not sure if you know, but the smiley at the end of this sentence will not be
recognized as a smiley by the average European/American)
Russian: :scream:
```

What I said is true. The parenthesis smiley is like a Slavic fingerprint upon a text. If someone uses it, you can be
certain they're either Slavic (e.g. Russian, Belorussian, Ukrainian, Kazakh et cetera) or, at least, someone imitating Slavic communication))

If readers don't know about the Slav smile, it'll just make them start searching for the beginning of a parenthesis they'll never find. This is unfortunate--your wish to communicate happiness will result in only confusion and fruitless search. I know, it happened to me.

I think I heard the Slav smile exists because the colon is inconvenient to type on a Cyrillic keyboard. That idea's supported by [this thread on stack exchange](https://russian.stackexchange.com/questions/13142/what-do-or-multiple-mean-in-an-internet-conversation), and I won't look into it any more than that.

I'm sure Slavs have many fine reasons to use the Slav smile,  but it doesn't make it any less confusing to the rest of us((
