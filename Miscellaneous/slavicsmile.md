# The Slavic Smile))

Here's a conversation I once had with a Russian friend:
````markdown
Russian: Thanks )
Matt: NP. Also, not sure if you know, but the smiley at the end of this sentence will not be recognized as a smiley by the average European/American).
Russian: :scream:
```

What I said is true. The smiley at the end of this sentence is like a Slavic fingerprint upon a text)).  If someone uses it, we can be nearly certain that they are Russian, Belorussian, Ukrainian, Kazakh et cetera. If they aren't, then they're at least someone want to imitate Slavic communication))

If readers don't know about the Slav smile, it'll just make them start searching for the beginning of a parenthesis that doesn't exist. I know, it happened to me.

I think I heard the Slav smile exists because the colon is inconvenient to type on a Cyrillic keyboard. That idea's supported b [this thread on stack exchange](https://russian.stackexchange.com/questions/13142/what-do-or-multiple-mean-in-an-internet-conversation), and I don't plan to research this any further.
Well I'm sure Slavs have many fine reasons to use the Slavic smile,  but it doesn't make it any less confusing to the rest of us((
