Here's an assortment of random tips. Maybe they'll link to other sections, some
day.

## Let me EXPLAIN SOMETHING to YOU

Remember, the object of `explain` is what is being explained. Lets look at the
the errors of Gennady.

```diffs
- Could you please explain me ~, have they tried to update
the library? 
+ Could you please explain *TO* me *whether they've* tried to update the library
```
When Gennady says `explain me`, that would literally mean `explain the
existence of Gennady`. Perhaps it's a valid question but it seems a bit
existential for a discussion about software.

*Here's the form:*

`Explain + CONCEPT + to PERSON` or `Explain + to PERSON + CONCEPT`  



## So vs Such
Quick tip: `So + adjective` and `such + (a/an) + adjective + noun`
 
"So" can only modify an adjective that isn't attached to a noun.
> It's so complicated :heavy\_check\_mark:
> It's so complicated project. :x:
> It's such a complicated project. :heavy\_check\_mark:

Generally, sentences with "such a ADJ" are going to have a "SO ADJ" near equivalence

> The country's so beautiful ~= it's such a beautiful country.

Be advised, when the noun is plural, of course don't add the article.

> Parrots are such festive birds.
