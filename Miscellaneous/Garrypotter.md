# Russians, Don't Call that Wizard Garry Potter!

It sounds absolutely ridiculous, because "Gary" is also a name. So when you say Gary Potter, it sounds like you're talking about some other "off-brand" wizard.

I know it's Russian pronunciation convention to convert the first sound to a G when a loanword begins with the "voiceless glottal fricative" (AKA the "h" sound), eg hormonal becomes "Gormonal".

 But Gary Potter is simply absurd.
