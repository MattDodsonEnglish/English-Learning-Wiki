Supplementary

For everything above, you could search expressions in Youglish. E.g. take 
piece of a grammar structure ("had been going") and search on Youglish to
see how real people are using it. Don't only listen, but repeat what they say,
this will enforce pronunciation and creation of natural expression.

Read and watch actively! Don't think only "I understand this information".
Think "why did these people say what they said the way the did?"

Practice vocabulary and grammar. Make cards, write sentences down.
Look for opportunities to use what you've learned in your daily life.

## Pronunciation: 

### Practice minimal pairs

http://tedpower.co.uk/l1russian.html


* ship vs sheep https://www.englishclub.com/pronunciation/minimal-pairs-e-i.htm
* Minimal Pair initial /v/ and /w/: https://www.englishclub.com/pronunciation/minimal-pairs-v-w-initial.php

To learn how to pronounce words like "opaque," research the magic "E"

### Practice mouth posture

American accent comes from the fact that all Americans generally position their
mouths in the same way. Practicing how to pronounce words could pay big dividends.

### Advanced-intonation

This video 30 minutes long and pretty detailed, but it's probably a good
investment of time for deep listening and producing natural English rhythms.

## Grammar

1. ### Getting started

#### Articles

Practice inserting articles into a text. See my post here:
https://ivelum.slack.com/archives/C0YNKL553/p1611856073120200

#### Irregular plurals

A classic mistake from is saying things like many "manys" or my two "childs/childrens"

So it'd be good to review this list of [irregular plurals](https://eslgrammar.org/regular-irregular-plural-nouns/)
This is a perfect job for Anki, by the way.

#### Continuous vs simple

```markdown
Form
<subject> + Verb-to-be + <verb-ing>
 I        +   am       +   running
```

The continuous is for actions happening close to the event. The simple is
for actions far from the event. This is true for present and past:

Present

"Cows eat grass"─this is a remote truth, not related to "now"

"Cows are eating grass"─this is a specific truth, related to now.

Past

"The cow ate grass" ─ a finished event, removed from other events
"The cow was eating grass" ─ a non-finished event, so we are speaking from
"inside" another past moment.

I personally wrote much more info here: https://github.com/MattDodsonEnglish/English-Learning-Wiki/blob/master/Grammar/verb-guide/aspect.md#the-continuous-aspect-describes-ongoing-activity

Exercises:
* https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/present-simple-present-continuous-1.html

### A little more sophisticated

#### Drill the past participles.

The past participles (sometimes called verb-3) are the verb forms that appear
in perfect constructions, after "have/has/had":

> I have seen
> He had become
> We wouldn't have known

And in passive constructions, as a kind of adjective:

> He is seen by many as a leader.
> Da Vinci kept working, driven by a ceaseless curiosity.

Even though I know you "know" the Past participles, sometimes you're not
using them where they should be:

> I haven't knew it before

All of the grammar below uses the past participles. So, when you're practicing
why not use this list of irregular ones?

* Irregular past participles. https://www.woodwardenglish.com/lesson/irregular-past-participles/

#### Perfect aspect 

The perfect provides background information to other events.

>He hasn't seen that movie, so he won't get the reference.

Here,"not seeing the movie" provides background information about "won't get
the reference."

The present perfect("have/has been") provides background information about the present;
the past perfect("had been") provides background info about a past event; the future
perfect("will have been")... well what do you think?

* Try to practice deciding whether to use one or the other [here](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/past-simple-present-perfect-1.html)
* Study these signal words, and make your own sentences using each one(rotate between I/ she/they and Negative/questions)
[signal words](https://www.englisch-hilfen.de/en/grammar/present_perfect_signal_words.htm)

#### Present perfect continuous

So, the continuous is for ongoing, and the perfect is for linking. In
that case, the perfect continuous must be to link an ongoing event to 
a later event

Exercises:
* Present perfect, or present perfect continuous? https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/present-perfect-simple-or-present-perfect-continuous.html

### Almost there

At this point, you'll need to understand at a conceptual level the idea
of clauses. However, you don't need to get too technical with it. If
you want to, check out the [clause section in writing advice](#understand-clauses) 


### Conditionals, 1 and 2

Conditionals describe sequences of events. The first conditional
describes sequences of real events. The two tenses used in the construction
reflect the 1-2 sequence of its meaning.  

* If I get tired, I'll take a nap.

"If" comes before "then," "tired" comes before "nap", and the present tense
comes before the future tense. See how all these things work together?

The second conditional describes sequences of unlikely,unreal events. Here
the construction is exactly the same as the first conditional, but everything
moves to the past tense ("would" is the past of "will).

> If the alien got tired, it would take a nap.

* (practice the conditionals here)[https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/first-conditional-exercise-1.html]
* (practice the second here.)[https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/conditional-exercises.html]
* [practice both:](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/support-files/all_conditionals_form_mixed_exercise.pdf)

### Past perfect

For describing how one past event relates to another past event.

>I hadn't logged in so I didn't see your message 

(linking how "not logging in" relates to "not seeing")

Or you can try the continuous version:

> I had been working all day, so I was tired

Exercises:
* Past perfect vs past continuous: https://elt.oup.com/student/solutions/upperint/grammar/grammar_02_022e?cc=ar&selLanguage=en
*  Past simple vs Past perfect: https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/past-perfect-exercise-3.html

### 3rd conditional

For describing the consequence of _past hypothetical_. Requires knowledge of past perfect.

>If that had happened, it would have been bad.

From here, you can also describe past probabilities and advice:

>I should've known, I could have been smart if I had studied

Exercises:

* Could have/would have/: https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/everyday-grammar-could-have-should-have-would-have/3391128.html
## Vocab:

Learn collocations between make, do, and take:
* https://english.lingolia.com/en/vocabulary/confusing-words/make-do-take

### Embedded questions/Reported speech

Understanding the clauses is the key to understanding embedded questions, one
of your most frequent errors.

"I want to know how are you doing?" → I want to know how you are doing

"I want to know" is the main clause, so the grammar of "how are you doing"
is subordinate to it. It won't have question syntax.

Similarly, reported speech embeds the secondary(reported clause) in its own tense.
The result is that, if the main clause is past tense, the sub-clause will be made
"paster."

"He said 'I have seen that movie'"→ "he said he had seen that movie"

* exercise about embedded questions: https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/embedded-questions.html
* exercise about reported speech: https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/reported-speech.html

## Vocab:

### Prepositions

Let's face it: prepositions are a huge pain in the ass to master. Very often
there's no logic, or there may be more than one correct answer. In my opionion
by far the best thing to do is make Anki cards that have whole Russian sentences 
on one side, that you must translate in English.

Only mark the card "good" if you can translate the entire sentence, with the 
proper preposition. After a while, it'll become automatic to produce the perfect
sentence, which will enforce good vocabulary patterns.

[Here's a great list to make cards from:](https://ieltsmaterial.com/advanced-grammar-for-ielts-prepositions/)

### Phrasal verbs

Vocab is a huge topic, but one way you could improve, and sound natural,
is by learning some more advanced phrasal verbs. With flash cards, it wouldn't
be too hard to learn these.

* https://breakoutenglish.com/advanced-cae/phrasal-verbs/


### Collocations 

*  Learn collocations between make, do, and take:
* https://english.lingolia.com/en/vocabulary/confusing-words/make-do-take

## Fluency

Fluency is a hard term to describe, but it generally means speaking with
out unnatural pauses and halts. It's also a hard concept to improve, but
there are ways.

### Think aloud

Sometimes, there are long pauses in your speech. Thinking before you
speak is a good practice, one I myself never learned, but if you think too
long your speaker will think you're paralyzed or stuck. On a zoom call, they
might think connect's failed (this has happened). Simply announcing you're
thinking reduces the discomfort of the silence:

* "Hold on,  let me(lemme) think it through."
* "That's a good question, lemme work it in my head."
* "Off the top of my head, I'd say"

Also if you forget somethign, say "wait let me circle back," or "Oops, I missed
something."

### Practice describing images

Next time you see some complicated diagram of a VPC, try to explain it outloud.
Actually, you can use this method for any picture.

Perhaps this sounds ridiculous, but so-called "photo-elicitation" is not a
technique I invented. In fact it's a known technique in various fields of research(including)
ESL), useful for practice speaking spontaneously and for describing things
only with the vocabulary you already have.

### Listen/watch content with dense amounts of language

Besides just watching, try to repeat after the characters, mimicking their
words and intonations. Good shows with lots of wordplay or non-standard speech
include:

* Arrested Development
* The Sopranos
* The Wire
* Curb your enthusiasm

Ok, so that's also a list of shows that I like. Really listen to any dense,
conversation heavy podcast. I don't know what you like, so you'll have to
find that yourself.

## Writing

Two books I can highly recommend are *Trees, Maps, and Theorems* and *Style: Clarity
and Grace*. Some of these ideas are from there.


### Understand clauses

This topic is a little theoretical, but learning should pay huge dividend. Once
you can figure out the difference between subordinate and main clauses, there's
no limit to the level of sentences you can create.

Basically, a clause is a subject verb pair.

These sentences have one clause:

> I am writing a report. (subject: "I"; verb: "report)
> Move the chair. (subject: "you"; verb: "move")

And these have two clauses:

> I am writing a report and my friend is talking on the phone.(Subj: -I, -friend; verbs: -write, -talk) 

>I am writing a report about how we learn clauses. (Subj: I , we ; verbs: write; learn)

However these two sentences have clauses in different ways. One sentence
can be broken into two complete sentence, the other cannot. Which one can't
be broken down? 

"how we learn clauses" can't be it's own clause. So, it's what we call
a subclause. Remove "and" and the first sentence functions perfectly fine
as two. These are called independent clauses.

As you can see, I could theoretically break these sentences down into YAML-like
objects. 

```YAML
clause: "how we learn"
  type: "sub-clause"
  dependency: "I am writing"
  subject "we"
```

I'm not going to continue with that because I want to keep my reports relatively short.

Once you have figured out how to identify clauses, you will be able to always
navigate to the core items of a sentence.

This engvid video taught me the concept, I hope it will help you:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsBbZqwU-c

Once you've learned them. It'll help your writing. Follow this simple guideline:
_put the main clause in the main point_


### Google technical writing courses

First do these two courses. They'll have the added benefit of teaching
you a little grammar.

* [Part one](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one)
* [Part two](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two)

After that, you can look at this guide for reference anytime:
* [Google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/lists)

### Subordinating clauses/logical connectors

After you can identify what main and sub-clauses are, learning how to use
logical connectors will give your sentences a tighter feel. Your arguments
will also feel more forceful and logically arranged.

There are four major functions of logical connectors:

* add supporting information
* add contrasting information
* add resulting information
* add conditionals

Here's an example paragraph full of connectors. Which function does each one serve?

*Unless* it rains tomorrow, I think the Bears are going to win, *because*
they play much better than the Packers. *However*, they always practice indoors,
_so_ if it rains, they Packers have a chance. *Even though* I want the Packers to win,
I like the bears too, *so*, no matter *whether my team wins or not*, I'm going
to enjoy the game.

Check your answers and see [a lot more examples here](https://staff.washington.edu/marynell/grammar/logicalconnectors.html)

### Advanced techniques

* Practice writing with modifiers. See this slack post: https://ivelum.slack.com/archives/C0YNKL553/p1611239052014200
* Think about sub and main clause. In technical writing, put the most important
info in the main clause.
* Revise paragraphs. Try to think about what the paragraph's main point is.
Put that at the beginning. After doing that, look to see if following sentences
can be removed.
