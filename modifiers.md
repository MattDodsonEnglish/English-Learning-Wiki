# Advanced writing tip: Modifiers

Modifiers are extensions at the end of a sentence. They can often replace relative clauses and simplify complex relationships.

```diff
-   He finally faced his biggest fear that had plagued him since he joined the team.
+ → He finally faced his biggest fear, a fear that had plagued him since he joined the team.
```
Here, we emphasize fear by repeating it.
Here are three useful kinds of modifiers

## 1. Resumptive modifiers

Like the "fear" example, resumptives take an object at the end of a sentence and replace it.
This would be easier in a more flexible language, a language that is dynamically typed.    
This examples longer, and doubled:

> The Swiss watchmakers' failure to capitalize on the invention of the digital timepiece was both astonishing and alarming — astonishing in that the Swiss had, since the beginnings of the industrial revolution in Europe, been among the first to capitalize on technical innovations, alarming in that a tremendous industrial potential had been lost to their chief competitors, the watchmakers of Japan.


## 2. Summary modifiers

Summary modifiers summarize the end of a sentence, usually an object or complement.


```markdown
                     {complement [   summary                       ]} 
This would be easier in python, a language that is dynamically typed.
```

Here "language" summarizes the meaning of "python". But the summary  could expand meaning considerably considerably:

```markdown
                        {                       complement                                           
At 2342 UTC +1, we lost power in the middle of a database migration,
[                            summary                                             ]} 
a rare combination of events that led to an extended period of data unavailability.
```
## Free modifiers

Free modifers refer again to the sentence's subject. In my example, all three modifiers refer to the subject, Da Vinci.

* They could be ing present participles, emphasizing activity.

```txt
Da Vinci was a curious man, studying everything in sight.
```

Or past participles, emphasizing a permanent state

```
Da Vinci studied everything in sight, driven by a ceaseless curiosity.
```

Or adjectives, simply adding a comment about the subject:

```text
Da Vinci studied everything, happy he didn't have to work a normal job.
```
