# Pronunciation

Pronunciation is a mechanical process. All spoken language is produced by mouths, and all mouths are
more or less the same.  Therefore,mechanically at least, we are capable of producing native-sounding 
speech in any language. Unfortunately, the patterns of our speech are mightily habitual, so most of us sound funny speaking a second tongue. Fortunately, things can improve.
