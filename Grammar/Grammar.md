# Do I need to learn Grammar?

**Short answer**, yes it it makes things a lot easier. However, I think it's self-evident
communication is the central aim of learning a language, and honestly many people
have learned to speak and understand an L2 without any understanding of the language's grammar. 

Yet, intuition can only carry a
person so far; after a
certain point, you will need to master the grammar to master the language.
Any way, no matter your level, learning how to wisely apply grammatical structures can only help your
communication skills. 


The good news is that **learning all the practical aspects of English Grammar is
far easier than learning all the practical aspects of a mature coding
language.<sup>Disclaimer</sup>**  


[Here's the long answer](./Do-I-Need-Grammar?.md)

_Disclaimer:_ Of course, grammar is just one part of a human language. Mastering
the entire range of a foreign language is probably harder than mastering a coding
language, or at least equally as hard. I don't know, I haven't done either.

# Verbs 

The verb is the most important part of an English sentence. A verb is the primary
place where a sentence's grammar happens, and it is the part of speech most
sensitive to change. For example, watch how the verb transforms when I modify
some part of the first sentence of this paragraph.

>The verb **is** the most important part of an English sentence.

>The verb*s* **are** the most important part of an English sentence.

>_He said that_ the verb **was** the most important part of the English sentence.

>_I would care about this wiki more, if_ the verb **were** the most important part
>of an english sentence.

Notice how changes in the subject's number, in sentence's tense, and the expression's
level of reality all depend on transformations around the verb.

English verb structures have three primary components, tense, aspect, and mood.
Very often these components can be combined together to create increasingly
sophisticated times and actions. 

For example, let's look at the present tense. If you are conscious right now,
you are in the present.  However, though it's
strange to imagine, there are are multiple forms of the present. It can be a 
general truth, like "Haskell is a functional language", a moment happening right
now, like "my friend is frying some potatoes", a moment happening around now, "I
am learning Haskell right now (for great good)". Complicated enough, but actually, the present can
also refer to finished actions, like "hear" in "I hear you are getting married"
or have in "I have heard that already" (yes, [the latter is present](#common-errors-2)), and it can
even refer to unlikely future events like "fly" in "I will go when pigs fly." Oh no, what
if the past and future tenses have equal amounts of complication? They do (maybe
more).

To a learner, these structures, especially the
more complex ones, seem daunting at first.  However they become much more manageable when we realize they stick together like modules.

## The Modules: Tense, Aspect, and Mood.

Every verb in every clause in English is going to have a **tense**, an **aspect** and a
**mood**. 

**Tense** is the time when the verb happened. The past is an example of a
tense, and this is an example of a sentence in the past tense, "We worked last
night." 

**Aspect** signifies whether a verb is finished, ongoing, or connected to
some other event. I like to think of aspect as the temporal texture of a verb.
The continuous is an aspect, and this is an example of a sentence in the past
tense that has a continuous aspect "We were working last night."


**Mood**, or modality, is a
little harder to pin down. A sentence's mood reflects the speaker's attitude
toward the sentence's contents. So, mood may reflect emotion, probability, or imagination.
Mood may also reflect the speaker's intention with the sentence, like making a
demand or asking a question. The interrogative is a mood, and this is an example of
a sentence in the past tense that has a continuous aspect and is in the
interrogative mood, "Were you working last night?" The conditional is also a
mood, and this is an an example of a sentence in the past tense that has a
continuous aspect and is in the conditional and interrogative moods. "Would you
have been working last night?" The imperative is also a mood, and there is no 
example of an imperative in the past tense. So that's one less
to learn. 


The following sections try to fit all these components together. It 
will have repetitive examples. This is intentional. With
the repetitions I would like to emphasize that each verb "module" is just a
component that can be stuck together with other components.

I'm going to start with aspect and mood, then return to finish with an
exhaustive demonstration of how aspects and moods work in each tense.

## Aspect

Aspect reflects a verb's composition in time. It determines whether the action
is complete or ongoing. In English, the two main aspects are the perfect, which
describes an events relation to another, and the continuous which describes an
events ongoing action. There are really three common aspects, if you consider
the [future](https://github.com/MattDodsonEnglish/English-Learning-Wiki/blob/master/Grammar/Future-Tense-or-Aspect%3F.md).

There is also the habitual aspect, which describes regular events. The most
habitual constructions are used to and would ("we *used to deploy* on Friday
evenings, which *would always make* me nervous.")

Like lego blocks, aspects can be grouped together to create more complex
constructions. Future, perfect, and continuous always can be combined together.
As far as I know the habitual can only be combined with the continuous.



### Perfect

The perfect describes relationships between events. 
Necessarily it is going to
involve two events in time: 
1. An event occurring at a definite moment in time;	
2. An event, occurring at an indefinite moment in time, that happened prior to
event (1) and also informs event (1) in some way.

The verb describing event (2) is going to be in the perfect. 
As long as event (2) occurs before event (1), any pairs in time are possible:
past-later-past; past-present; past-future; present-future; later future-future.

Take a look at the following three pictures. In each one, someone has eaten. 
"i" stands for information. In this case it carries the information "a belly full
of food". 


![Present Perfect](../Images/presentperfect.jpg)

![Past Perfect](../Images/Pastperfect.jpg)

![Future Perfect](../Images/futureperfect.jpg)

  
The perfect signifies completion in many languages. I think it does
in english too, except when the perfect continous happens.

It is constructed with "have" followed by the past participle of the following verb.







### Continuous

The continous describes ongoing activity. It emphasizes the _action_ of a verb.

It is constucted with the verb to be followed by the present participle of the
following verb.

### Habitual

The habitual describes the events that repeated in periods of time. There are
two principal constructions of the habitual: "used to" + verb and "would+verb"

They are mostly interchangeable, but only used to can be used for states, like
living.

Both of these are fine:

> My uncles would watch cricket on sundays.
> My aunts used to watch Football on thanksgiving.

But only "used to" is correct here:

```diff
-I would live in New York city in the 1990s
+I used to live in New York city in the 1990s
```

Here is a graphic using cutting edge teaching software:


There are other verb constructions that can describe habitual activities, like keep +ing

>I keep forgetting how to log in.


Frankly I didn't want to write about the habitual because it messes up my theory
that all aspects can be combined, and that all aspects can have tenses. Yet "used to" and "would"(in this sense) can only be used in the past, and, as far as I can reckon, they can only be combined with the future. I think there are a few reasons. One, the habitual present is just the present simple. The other is that I think "used to" functions as something like a defective verb, and that all of these are forms of verbal peraphrasis. 


### Future-Tense or Aspect?

The future is not really a tense, but an aspect.  However, because this wiki is
intended for quick, practical use. I'm going to group the future under the tense
category.

Yet, as I wrote this wiki, I became convinced that the distinction is not so
trivial if you're really worried about grammar. If you are interested, I typed a
small explanation of [why I think so](https://github.com/MattDodsonEnglish/English-Learning-Wiki/blob/master/Grammar/Future-Tense-or-Aspect%3F.md) 

## Mood 

## Tense

Tense refers to the time when the action of a sentence takes place. In English
we have three tenses: the present, the past, and the future.  Actually,
linguists usually say English has only two tenses, because they don't consider
the English future to really be a tense. This is a fascinating point of discussion
, but not relevant to the task of this wiki.

### Present

It's where we live. You probably have heard of the present tense.


#### Simple

The basic form is called the Present simple. The present simple describes, the
habitual, the abstract, and the generally true.

> He thinks about you all the time.
> Now I *work* down in the car yard, where all *it ever does* *is* rain.
> A human is a featherless biped.

It also describes states:

>The system is down.

##### Common Errors:
* Using the present continuous where it shouldn't be.
> My daughter ~is listening~ **listens** to music all the time
* Basic conjugation problems
> He ~~don't~~ **doesn't** work on the back-end. 

#### Continuous 
(also called the progressive)
```Markdown
Form:
. Subject + Verb to be +present participle`
? Verb to be + subject present participle
```
The present continuous describes situations happening _now or around now._
> The system is down, but "Gennady *is working* on it."

It can also be used for _future arrangements_.

> We are migrating the system next tuesday.

It **should not** be used for things that are true all the time. The present
simple is used for that.
``` Diff
-Bees are making honey.
+Bees make honey
```
_Unless some bees are making honey right now. But there should be some 
determiner, like 'the' or 'some' in that case._

##### Common Errors
* Using the continuous when the present simple should be used (see above)
* Using the present continuous to describe duration(the [perfect](#Perfect) should be used)
```diff
- They are working here a long time.
+ They've [worked][been working] here a long time.
```
* Some [verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stative_verb), like "know",
  "agree", and "belong", simply just don't pair well with the continuous tense.
  Generally, these verbs describe mental and emotional states ("imagine"),
  senses ("smell"), and communication ("deny"). 
   * However this is not a hard and fast rule.
     [This website](https://www.ecenglish.com/learnenglish/lessons/non-continuous-verbs)
   provides some good examples of exceptions.

#### Perfect
```
Form:
. Subject + have + past participle
   She       has    eaten           
? Have + subject + Past participle
   Has     she       eaten?
```   
The present perfect describes an action occurred, or started to occur in the
past, yet which is still relevant in the present. 

>Of course Innokenty can migrate a database. He has done it many times.

Innokenty's past experience of migrating databases informs his present condition
of being able to migrate a database. It's interesting that we use the verb "to have"
as an auxiliary here. Experience is like a possession, and one that can never be
taken from you. When I say "She has climbed K2." I am saying that her experience
of climbing K2 in some way informs her present condition. 

Certain markers of time, like already and never, strongly collocate with the present perfect. 

> Gennady's not hungry. He's already eaten.

The fact that he already ate informs the fact that he is not hungry.

> I don't know if mastering a natural language is harder than mastering a
> programming language. I've never done either.

The fact that I have not mastered a programming language or mastered a
natural language informs the fact that I cannot compare the two.

The fact that "already" and "never" both pair so well with the present perfect
makes sense. It's a matter of harmony between the grammatical meaning of the
structure and the semantic meaning of the word.  "Already" means "prior to".
When we discuss an event that already happened,we often discuss its results.
Similarly, never means "from origin until now". So when I say "I've never been
to Spain", embedded in that sentence is lots of information about the past: eg
that when I was a baby, I did not go to Spain; when I was ten I did not go to
Spain; when I was ten years and one month I did not go to Spain...

Here are some other words that pair well with the perfect.

```
    just
    yet
    never
    already
    ever
    so far
    up to now
    recently
    since
    for
```
Think for yourself: why do the words above pair so well with grammar that links
events? Try to imagine the contexts where these words are used.

##### Common Errors

**The present perfect is a present tense.** That's why I put it in the "present"
tense section. When you use markers that anchor the phrase in the past, don't
use the present perfect. 

```diff
- Yesterday, Gennady and Innokenty have fixed the issue.
+ Yesterday, Gennady and Innokenty fixed the issue
```

Why would you use a present tense when speaking about yesterday? To repeat, **The present perfect is a present tense.** 

#### Present Perfect Continuous

```Form
. S + Have/has + been + -ing
  She   has       been   eating
? Have/has + S + been + ing
  Has        she been   eating
  ```

The [perfect](#perfect) in English describes events linked to some later time.
The [continuous](#continuous) describes events that did not finish. So it
follows that the **perfect continuous describes events that did not finish and
are linked to some later time**.

In the **present** perfect continuous, the events link to the present.

>Ever since we changed providers, the pages have been loading much faster.

_The loading of the pages is a continuous process, beginning at the time we
changed providers and continuing to now._


### Past

As you read this sentence, you are reading in the present. Now try to remember
that last sentence you read. You were reading that sentence a few moments ago.
It was a good time.

#### Past Simple

The past simple simple has multiple functions:

* Finished actions
> I went there yesterday.

> Thomas Sankara was a great president.

* Sequences in stories.

> Last night thieves broke into my when I was on vacation. They broke the backdoor window then unlocked the door. After they entered, they came into my bedroom, stole all my socks, and left.

* Introducing the condition in a hypothetical

> If I were you ...

The past simple is the workhorse of the past tense. If you are not sure about whether to use the past simple or some other form, like the present perfect or the habitual, it'll be safer to use the past simple. 

##### Common errors
* Mispronuncing [-ed forms](https://7esl.com/pronunciation-of-ed/)
* Misconjugating [irregular forms](https://grammar.cl/Past/Irregular_Verbs_List.htm)
* Using the past simple when the [present](#present-perfect) or [past perfect](#past-perfect) would be better.
 
#### Past Continuous
#### Past Perfect

The perfect links events in time. The past tense refers to the past. Therefore, the past perfect therefore links an event in the past with an earlier event.

#### Perfect Past Continuous

The 

### Future
#### Will and Going to
#### Future Continuous
#### Future Perfect
#### Future Perfect Continuous
