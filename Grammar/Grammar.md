Grammar is the set of rules governing how we speak a language.

# Do I need to learn Grammar?

**Short answer**, yes it would help. But the actual practice of communicating is
much more more important, and practice alone can probably get you to a point
where you can communicate most things that you want to. However, to master a
language, you will need to master the grammar.

The good news is that **learning all the practical aspects of English Grammar is
far easier than learning all the practical aspects of a mature coding
language.<sup>Disclaimer</sup>**  


[Here's the long answer](./Do-I-Need-Grammar?.md)

_Disclaimer:_ Of course, grammar is just one part of a human language. Mastering
the entire range of a foreign language is probably harder than mastering a coding
language, or at least equally as hard.

# Verbs 

The verb is the most important part of an English sentence. A verb is the primary
place where a sentence's grammar happens, and it is the part of speech most
sensitive to change. For example, what how the verb transforms when I modify
some part of the first sentence of this paragraph.

>The verb **is** the most important part of an English sentence.

>The verb*s* **are** the most important part of an English sentence.

>_He said that_ the verb **was** the most important part of the English sentence.

>_I would care about this wiki more, if_ the verb **were** the most important part
>of an english sentence.

Notice how changes in the subjects number, in the sentence tense, and in the
sentence's level of reality all depend on transformations around the verb.

English verb structures have three primary components, tense, aspect, and mood.
Very often these components can be combined together to create increasingly
sophisticated times and actions. 

For example, let's look at the present tense. If you are conscious right now,
you are in the present.  However, though it's
strange to imagine, there are are multiple forms of the present. It can be a 
general truth, like "Haskell is a functional language", a moment happening right
now, like "my friend is frying some potatoes", a moment happening around now, "I
am learning Haskell right now (for great good)". Complicated enough, but actually, the present can
also refer to finished actions, like "hear" in "I hear you are getting married"
or have in "I have heard that already" (yes, the latter is present), and it can
even refer to future events like "fly" in "I will go when pigs fly." Oh no, what
if the past and future tenses have equal amounts of complication? They do (maybe
more.

To a learner, these structures, especially the
more complex ones, seem daunting at first.  However they become much more manageable when we realize they stick together like modules.

## The Modules: Tense, Aspect, and Mood.

Every verb in every clause in English is going to have a **tense**, an **aspect** and a
**mood**. Tense is the time when the verb happened. The past is an example of a
tense, and this is an example of a sentence in the past tense. "We worked last
night" Aspect signifies whether a verb is finished, ongoing, or connected to
some other event. I like to think of aspect as the temporal texture of a verb.
The continuous is an aspect, and this is an example of a sentence in the past
tense that has a continuous aspect "We were working last night.". Mood, or modality, is a
little harder to pin down. A sentence's mood reflects the speakers attitude
toward its contents. So, mood may reflect emotion, probability, or imagination.
Mood may also reflect the speaker's intention with the sentence, like make a
demand or ask a question. The interrogative is a mood, and this is an example of
a sentence in the past tense that has a continuous aspect and is in the
interrogative mood, "Were you working last night?". The conditional is also a
mood, and this is an an example of a sentence in the past tense that has a
continuous aspect and is in the conditional and interrogative moods. "Would you
have been working last night?"  

The imperative is also mood, and there is no example of an imperative in the past tense. So that's one less
to learn. 


The following section tries to fit all these tenses and moods together. It will have repetitive examples. This is intentional. With
the repetitions I would like to emphasize that each verb "module" is just a
component that can be stuck together with other components.

## Tense

Tense refers to the time when the action of a sentence takes place. In English
we have three tenses: the present, the past, and the future.  Actually,
Linguists usually say English has only two tenses, because they don't consider
the English future to really be tense. This is a fascinating point of discussion
topic, but not relevant to the task of this wiki.

### Present

It's where we live. You probably have heard of the present tense.


##### Simple

The basic form is called the Present simple. The present simple describes, the habitual, the
abstract, and the generally true.

>He thinks about you all the time.
> Now I *work* down in the car yard, where all *it ever does* *is* rain.
> A human is a featherless biped.

Common errors include:
* Using the present continuous where it shouldn't be.
> My daughter ~is listening~ **listens** to music all the time
* Basic conjugation problems
> He ~~don't~~ **doesn't** work on the back-end. 

#### Present + continuous aspect

The continuous is always marked by *a form of the verb to be followed by a present participle (-ing)*
