Grammar is the set of rules governing how we speak a language.

# Do I need to learn Grammar?

**Short answer**, yes it it makes things a lot easier. Yet I think it's self-evident
that ability to communicate the aim of learning a language, and honestly people
do learn to communicate without learning a grammar. Intuition can only carry a
person so far; after a
certain point, you will need to master the grammar to master the language.
Any way, no matter your level, learning how to wisely apply grammatical structures can only help your
communication skills. 


The good news is that **learning all the practical aspects of English Grammar is
far easier than learning all the practical aspects of a mature coding
language.<sup>Disclaimer</sup>**  


[Here's the long answer](./Do-I-Need-Grammar?.md)

_Disclaimer:_ Of course, grammar is just one part of a human language. Mastering
the entire range of a foreign language is probably harder than mastering a coding
language, or at least equally as hard. I don't know, I haven't done either.

# Verbs 

The verb is the most important part of an English sentence. A verb is the primary
place where a sentence's grammar happens, and it is the part of speech most
sensitive to change. For example, watch how the verb transforms when I modify
some part of the first sentence of this paragraph.

>The verb **is** the most important part of an English sentence.

>The verb*s* **are** the most important part of an English sentence.

>_He said that_ the verb **was** the most important part of the English sentence.

>_I would care about this wiki more, if_ the verb **were** the most important part
>of an english sentence.

Notice how changes in the subject's number, in sentence's tense, and expressions's
level of reality all depend on transformations around the verb.

English verb structures have three primary components, tense, aspect, and mood.
Very often these components can be combined together to create increasingly
sophisticated times and actions. 

For example, let's look at the present tense. If you are conscious right now,
you are in the present.  However, though it's
strange to imagine, there are are multiple forms of the present. It can be a 
general truth, like "Haskell is a functional language", a moment happening right
now, like "my friend is frying some potatoes", a moment happening around now, "I
am learning Haskell right now (for great good)". Complicated enough, but actually, the present can
also refer to finished actions, like "hear" in "I hear you are getting married"
or have in "I have heard that already" (yes, the latter is present), and it can
even refer to unlikely future events like "fly" in "I will go when pigs fly." Oh no, what
if the past and future tenses have equal amounts of complication? They do (maybe
more).

To a learner, these structures, especially the
more complex ones, seem daunting at first.  However they become much more manageable when we realize they stick together like modules.

## The Modules: Tense, Aspect, and Mood.

Every verb in every clause in English is going to have a **tense**, an **aspect** and a
**mood**. 

**Tense** is the time when the verb happened. The past is an example of a
tense, and this is an example of a sentence in the past tense, "We worked last
night." 

**Aspect** signifies whether a verb is finished, ongoing, or connected to
some other event. I like to think of aspect as the temporal texture of a verb.
The continuous is an aspect, and this is an example of a sentence in the past
tense that has a continuous aspect "We were working last night."


**Mood**, or modality, is a
little harder to pin down. A sentence's mood reflects the speaker's attitude
toward the sentence's contents. So, mood may reflect emotion, probability, or imagination.
Mood may also reflect the speaker's intention with the sentence, like making a
demand or asking a question. The interrogative is a mood, and this is an example of
a sentence in the past tense that has a continuous aspect and is in the
interrogative mood, "Were you working last night?" The conditional is also a
mood, and this is an an example of a sentence in the past tense that has a
continuous aspect and is in the conditional and interrogative moods. "Would you
have been working last night?" The imperative is also a mood, and there is no 
example of an imperative in the past tense. So that's one less
to learn. 


The following sections try to fit all these components together. It 
will have repetitive examples. This is intentional. With
the repetitions I would like to emphasize that each verb "module" is just a
component that can be stuck together with other components.

I'm going to start with aspect and mood, then return to finish with an
exhaustive demonstration of how aspects and moods work in each tense.



## Tense

Tense refers to the time when the action of a sentence takes place. In English
we have three tenses: the present, the past, and the future.  Actually,
linguists usually say English has only two tenses, because they don't consider
the English future to really be a tense. This is a fascinating point of discussion
, but not relevant to the task of this wiki.

### Present

It's where we live. You probably have heard of the present tense.


#### Simple

The basic form is called the Present simple. The present simple describes, the
habitual, the abstract, and the generally true.

> He thinks about you all the time.
> Now I *work* down in the car yard, where all *it ever does* *is* rain.
> A human is a featherless biped.

It also describes states:

>The system is down.

##### Common errors:
* Using the present continuous where it shouldn't be.
> My daughter ~is listening~ **listens** to music all the time
* Basic conjugation problems
> He ~~don't~~ **doesn't** work on the back-end. 

#### Continuous 
(also called the progressive)
```Markdown
Form:
. Subject + Verb to be +present participle`
? Verb to be + subject present participle
```
The present continuous describes situations happening _now or around now._
> The system is down, but "Gennady *is working* on it."

It can also be used for _future arrangements_.

> We are migrating the system next tuesday.

It **should not** be used for things that are true all the time. The present
simple is used for that.
``` Diff
-Bees are making honey.
+Bees make honey
```

_Unless some bees are making honey right now. But there should be some 
determiner, like 'the' or 'some' in that case._

##### Common Errors
* Using the continuous when the present simple should be used (see above)
* Using the present continuous to describe duration(the [perfect](#Perfect) should be used)
```diff
- They are working here a long time.
+ They've [worked][been working] here a long time.
```
* Some [verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stative_verb), like "know",
  "agree", and "belong", simply just don't pair well with the continuous tense.
  Generally, these verbs describe mental and emotional states ("imagine"),
  senses ("smell"), and communication ("deny"). 
   * However this is not a hard and fast rule.
     [This website](https://www.ecenglish.com/learnenglish/lessons/non-continuous-verbs)
   provides some good examples of exceptions.

#### Perfect
```
Form:
. Subject + have + past participle
   She       has    eaten           
? Have + subject + Past participle
   Has     she       eaten?
```   
The present perfect describes an action occurred, or started to occur in the
past, yet which is still relevant in the present. 

>Of course Innokenty can migrate a database. He has done it many times.

Innokenty's past experience of migrating databases informs his present condition
of being able to migrate a database. It's interesting that we use the verb "to have"
as an auxiliary here. Experience is like a possession, and one that can never be
taken from you. When I say "She has climbed K2." I am saying that her experience
of climbing K2 in some way informs her present condition. 

Certain markers of time, like already and never, strongly collocate with the present perfect. 

> Gennady's not hungry. He's already eaten.

The fact that he already ate informs the fact that he is not hungry.

> I don't know if mastering a natural language is harder than mastering a
> programming language. I've never done either.

The fact that I have not mastered a programming language or mastered a
natural language informs the fact that I cannot compare the two.

The fact that "already" and "never" both pair so well with the present perfect
makes sense. It's a matter of harmony between the grammatical meaning of the
structure and the semantic meaning of the word.  "Already" means "prior to".
When we discuss an event that already happened,we often discuss its results.
Similarly, never means "from origin until now". So when I say "I've never been
to Spain", embedded in that sentence is lots of information about the past: eg
that when I was a baby, I did not go to Spain; when I was ten I did not go to
Spain; when I was ten years and one month I did not go to Spain...

Here are some other words that pair well with the perfect.

```
    just
    yet
    never
    already
    ever
    so far
    up to now
    recently
    since
    for
```
Think for yourself: why do the words above pair so well with grammar that links
events? Try to imagine the contexts where these words are used.

##### Common Errors

**The present perfect is a present tense.** That's why I put it in the "present"
tense section. When you use markers that anchor the phrase in the past, don't
use the present perfect. 

```diff
- Yesterday, Gennady and Innokenty have fixed the issue.
+ Yesterday, Gennady and Innokenty fixed the issue
```

Why would you use a present tense when speaking about yesterday? To repeat, **The present perfect is a present tense.**
