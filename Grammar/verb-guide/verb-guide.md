# All things and all times
_an intuitive guide to verbs_

The verb is the most important part of an English sentence. A verb is the primary
place where a sentence's grammar happens, and it is the part of speech most
sensitive to change. For example, watch how the verb transforms when I modify
the sentence's beginning[in square brackets]. 

>The verb **is** the most important part of an English sentence.

>[Verbs] **are** the most important part of an English sentence.

>[Yesterday,] the verb **was** the most important part of the English sentence.

>The verb [always] **has been** the most important part of an English sentence.

>[I would care about this article more if] the verb **were** the most important part
>of an english sentence.

Notice how changes in the subject's number ("verb" vs "verbs"), in the sentence's tense, in the sentence's duration ("always"), andthe expression's level of reality all depend on transformations around the verb.

As I said in my introduction, a key design feature of language is that it
can talk about all things, at all times[(called displacement°)](https://www.thoughtco.com/displacement-language-term-1690399).
While vocabulary determines the _semantic meaning_ of a sentence (e.g. "yesterday's apple" expresses a time and an object), grammatically, language's enormous
power of displacement stems from the mighty verb. In fact, only three components
are needed to determine all places and times:

* **Tense** ─ the time of an action, e.g. present or past
* **Aspect** ─ the duration of an action, e.g. continuous, repeated, finished, et cetera
* **Mood** ─ the reality of an action, e.g. real, unreal, probable, or necessary

Mastering English tense, aspect, and mood in English will give you the power
to grammatically express all possible things and all possible times. Though you'd
think the list of necessary structures to be lengthy, in fact the list is relatively
short. Furthermore, the topics build on each other. Folow these steps to speak
about all things and times.


Steps 1, 2, and 3 give you all the necessary items and conjugations.

1. [Learn the tenses](./tense.md): present, past (and future)
2. [Learn the aspects](./aspect.md): perfect and continuous
3. [Learn the modals](./modals.md)

From these building blocks, you can create sentences of infinite complexity. 
Steps 4 and 5 teach you how to combine these items to create conditions and
embedded clauses.

4. Learn the conditionals: real and imaginary
5. Learn how to embed clauses: reported speech and embedded sentences.

It might be hard to remember how arrange structures with multiple aspects and modal.
Don't worry, there's an order of operations.
