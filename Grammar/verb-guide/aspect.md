  Prerequisites: To correctly form these structures, you'll first need to understand
how to conjugate the present and past simple, especially for the verbs "to do,"
"to have," and "to be." You'll also need to learn the present participle[(i.e.
the "-ing" form°)](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/present_participle.htm)
and the past[(i.e. "verb 3" form°](https://englishstudyhere.com/verbs/50-examples-of-present-tense-past-tense-and-past-participle/) participles.

_Aspect_<sup>[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense)</sup> expresses
how an event is composed with the flow of time. 

In our examples of the [present and past simple], the events have no real composition
in the flow of time. Saying "the horse eats grass," or "Gennady Golovkin is a
boxer," are always true, which in turn means that they don't have any particular
event. Furthermore, although "the horse ate the grass" expresses an particular event,it has no
specific composition across time; we know only that an event happened, we have
no idea how long the event occured. For example, we don't know

* Whether the action continued or finished
* Whether it had a relation to another action
* Whether it was a habitual or one time event,

Fortunately, it's absolutely possible to express all of these things through
grammar. For that, we have aspect. 

This section specifically focuses on the ongoing, or the _continuous aspect_ 
and the relaion, or _perfect aspect_. This is for two reasons. First, these
aspects are by far the most common. Second, they serve as building blocks
for future sections, and accomodating the habitual aspect would wreck my whole
theory.

## Aspect creates texture in time 

As there are many textures in the flow of time, aspect can express a number of things
about an event: whether it's complete or ongoing
