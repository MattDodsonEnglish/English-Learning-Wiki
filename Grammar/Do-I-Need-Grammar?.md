# Do I need Grammar?

The two most popular notions about learning a language stand in direct
opposition to each other. The first claims that one must master a language's
grammar before they can properly speak it. Grammar is the backbone of a
language, after all. The second says one actually doesn't need to bother
learning grammar at all. Just speak and receive inputs. That's how a child
learns, after all. 

There are reasonable people on both sides of argument. They must think, like
Leonard Cohen, "One of us cannot be wrong." Personally I'm against any notion of
a One True Path, but I think neither argument holds up to much scrutiny.

First let's address the old-school notion that "Grammar is King." I think anyone
with a brain will realize that grammar can only get you so far. What happened to
the hundreds of thousands of people who studied a language for ten years only
to arrive in the country of their L2 and find their powers of expression
rudimentary at best? Did they not do perform enough grammar exercises Secondly
how do you even practice actually using grammar without making mistakes along
the way? Doing rote grammar exercises is not real practice. **Creating**
original sentences that use a grammar structure is real practice. In my
experience as a learner and a teacher, figuring out a way to just get your
message out is the first hurdle. Having done that, it's much easier to make the
words fit perfectly in their place. Finally, what you can do with a language is
what matters. I once knew a man who worked in a air traffic control tower. The
man was from Cuba and had immigrated in the 70s or 80s. Everyday of his life he
would say "he don't" instead of "he doesn't". This is a mistake that gets fixed
in the first days of class! Yet this man was able to go to work five days a week
and use his English to communicate highly dynamic radar and meteorological data
within an intensely stressful work environment, and do so in a manner that
prevented large bodies of aircraft from hurtling violently into themselves or
into the ground. Fortunately the difference between "he don't and he doesn't"
was no cause for literal disaster.

I think the language institutions of the world have broadly realized the
weakness of the Grammar-only approach. However,the idea that we should
completely avoid learning any grammar is nearly as ridiculous. But that's "just
how kids learn." My teacher Phil once made a good point: kids take 5-7 years to
master a language, adults usually don't have that amount of time. Learning
grammar almost certainly accelerates the learning process. Just knowing the
structure provides you a scaffolding to create sentences using any word you
know. Secondly, certain expressions, like a past hypothetical, require a certain
level of grammatical sophistication that is very difficult to learn through
sheer intuition. Lastly, many of you are working or will work in contexts where you will need
to
communicate in writing, and do so as clearly as possible. When you say something
like "He don't," your listener forgets the error as soon as the sentence ends.
When you write something like "he don't", your users will read the error everytime they open the manual, and in
time they may grow to distrust, or even despise, you. Furthermore, unlike the air control
tower, your reader can't ask you to "Say again". So, aim to be perfect.
