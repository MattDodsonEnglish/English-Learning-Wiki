# Is the Future a Tense or an Aspect?

The future is an aspect.

Right when I started teaching, I learned that technically the future is an aspect, not a
tense. I thought that was just a meaningless distinction, and I think for most
students it is. But when I really started to look at the grammar with a
microscope, I realized it doesn't really make sense to call the future a tense.
Here are some reasons why.

## No future conjugation

On the basic level, the future is not a tense because there is no future conjugation:

>Yesterday Jenya work**ed**
>
>Today Jenya work**s**
>
>Tomorrow, Jenya work **{?}** 

Compare Spanish or French, which have future conjugations:
> Mañana Jenya Trabajará,
>
> Demain Jenya Travaillera

Russian, on the other hand, also seems to be without a real future tense:
> Я бу́ду рабо́тать

### Modals and Present Tenses Mark the Future


So how do we describe the future? Many ways, but not with a future tense:
* Present simple:
> When you arrive next month
* Present progressive
> We are moving to Sweden next week
* Present progressive of "to go":
> We are going to move to sweden.

So what about about "will"?

>When you arrive next month, I will teach you Swedish.

But "will" is a modal, like might. It just expresses strong eventuality, moments
where _p=~1_. But really _p != 1_, we don't know the future. Anyway the event
"teach you Swedish" occurs after the already future event "when you arrive."
Will relates modally to causality.


Secondly, you can mix aspects but not tenses. We can have continuous and
  perfect, but we can't have past and present. Yet we can combine future with
  the present and the past. 

> I didn't know Gennady was going to work today.

So we have the future perfect progressive in the only two tenses possible.
1. **The present**:
When you get here, I will have been working for hours and I doubt I'll have any more energy.
2. **The past**:
I thought that when you got here, I would have been working for  horse.

That's a real instance of the future perfect progressive. But the future-perfect construction is so crazy that it's typically only used to speak about counterfactual historical events:

>The world would have been different if the internet hadn't been invented.

In fact many languages use the past tense to speak about the unreal.


All other modals like 'might', 'shall'('should' in the past, and 'can'('could'
in the past) also be in the present or the past tenses, but they can't be in the
future to the future. Why? For two
reasons: 
1. Modals, like tenses, can't be combined*. Only aspects can be combined. 
2. Because, most importantly...
...The future is not a tense!
