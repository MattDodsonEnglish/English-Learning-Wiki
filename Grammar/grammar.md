# Grammar

Grammar is a huge topic, worthy of a life's study. I'm not pretending to present
a comprehensive reference. Rather, this is a learner's guide to the most practical,
most profitable topics of study.
If you master these, you won't have mastered the English language, but you'll
have a great working foundation.

## Topics

This page contains only short summaries. You'll find links to the detailed
articles in each section.

* [Do I even need to learn grammar?](#do-i-even-need-to-learn-grammar%3F)
* [All things at all times: a guide to verbs](./verb-guide). Mastering tense,
aspect, and mood will give you enough grammatical range to discuss all things,
real and imaginary, that happened during all times. Not bad!

## Do I even need to learn Grammar?

**Short answer**, yes it it makes things a lot easier. However, I think it's self-evident
communication is the central aim of learning a language, and honestly many people
have learned to speak and understand an L2 without any understanding of the language's grammar. 

Yet, intuition can only carry a person so far; after a
certain point, you will need to master the grammar to master the language.
Any way, no matter your level, learning how to wisely apply grammatical structures can only help your
communication skills. 


The good news is that **learning all the practical aspects of English Grammar is
far easier than learning all the practical aspects of a mature coding
language.<sup>Disclaimer</sup>**  


[Here's the long answer](./Do-I-Need-Grammar%3F.md)

_Disclaimer:_ Of course, grammar is just one part of a human language. Mastering
the entire range of a foreign language is probably harder than mastering a coding
language, or at least equally as hard. I don't know, I haven't done either.
