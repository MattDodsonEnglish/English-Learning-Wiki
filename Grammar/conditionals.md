# Conditionals
```
TL,DR: the grammar of conditional sentences coheres with their meaning. "If"
 comes before "then", so the tense of the "then" clause will be future of the 
if. EG "If it rains" is present tense,"Then the street will be wet" is future
tense. This makes sense, as rain precedes a wet street, as present precedes
future, as "if" precedes "then." When we want to speak about unreal events,
we move the clauses of present conditional to the past tense "If it rained on
the sun, the solar street would be wet", and the clauses of past conditional
to the perfect aspect, "if JFK had not been assinated, the 1960s would have
been different".

Students struggle with conditional sentences. There's no doubt they are tricky. However, when we break the conditional structure down into parts, we find there's a pretty simple logic to them.

A conditional sentence expresses what happens as a result of something else happening.
They involve two events, the condition and its outcome, and have two clauses, the conditional (ie "if") and the consequence (ie then).

The grammar of the conditional sentence coheres with its semantic meaning.
"If" comes before "then," so the tense of the "then" clause is 
future to the tense of the "if" clause.

| Row 3 Column 1 | Row 3 Column 2 | Row 3 Column 3 |

| present |future |
|---------|-------|
|If it rains,| the street will be wet.|

Conditionals can be present or past, real or unreal. When the condition is unreal and present, we mark
that by moving clauses to the past.

| present  |   future |
|----------|----------|
|If I were you| I would not go tomorrow.|

_Note: will is the past of would!_

When the conditional is unreal and past, we move add the perfect aspect (eg had/would have) to the clauses.

|past|later past|
|----|-----------|
|If I had been you| I wouldn't have gone yesterday|


## There's always an exception: 0-conditionals

0 conditionals describe simultaneauos events, so the "if" and "then" clauses are the same.

|present|also present|

|when temperature increases|pressure does too|
