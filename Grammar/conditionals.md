# Conditionals

``` markdown
Short Version: the grammar of conditional sentences coheres with their
meaning. "If" comes before "then", so the tense of the "then" clause will be
future of the "if" clause. EG "If it rains, then the street will be wet". This
makes sense, as rain precedes a wet street, present precedes future, and "if"
precedes "then." When we want to speak about unreal events, we move the clauses
of present conditional to the past tense. "If it rained on the moon, the lunar
street would be wet", and the clauses of past conditional to the perfect aspect,
"if JFK had not been assinated, the 1960s would have been different".
```

-----
A conditional sentence expresses what happens as a result of something else happening.
They involve two events, the condition and its outcome, and have two clauses,
the conditional (i.e. "if") and the consequence (i.e. then).
Students struggle with conditional sentences. They can be tricky, there's no
doubt. However, when we break the conditional structure down into parts, we find
there's a pretty simple logic to them.

QUIZ: what comes first:

* a) If or b) then?
* a) is or b) will be?
* a) rain or b) wet street?

Of course, the answer is always "a)". And this sequence reveals the structure
of the conditional.

> If it **rains**, the street **will be** wet.

The grammar of the conditional sentence coheres with its semantic meaning.
"Then" comes after "if" so the tense of the then-clause is
future to the tense of the if-clause.

Conditionals can be present or past, real or unreal. For my examples, I'm going
to use "have" as the verb for the conditional clause and "be" as the verb for
the main clause.  

## Real Situations

When the conditional is _present and real_, put the if-clause in the present
simple and the then-clause in the future:

| Moment | Later Moment |
|---------|-------|
|If you already **have** a ticket,| you **won't be in a rush**.

**NOTE:** Never say "if I will have..."! Just don't do it!

### Rare: Real past conditional 

When the condition is _past and real_, simply move the tenses of the "if" and "then" clauses
to the past. So "have" becomes "had", and "won't be" becomes "wouldn't
be". Yes, "would" is the past tense of "will" (really!)  

|Past Moment | Later past moment |
|------------|-------|
|They knew that if you already **had** a ticket,|you **wouldn't be in a rush**.|

**Note:** This construction is rather rare. It's mainly used in three cases:
* For 1st conditionals in reported speech (as above)
* In works of fiction written in the past tense.
* For past habitual conditionals, eg "When I was a kid I would take the train.
In times when I alread had a ticket, I wouldn't rush.

It's fairly uncommon to see these three examples. But the structure is very
common! That's because it's also used for unreal present conditionals.

## Unreal Situations

As in other languages, English often puts constructions in the past to add
a layer of irreality.

When the condition is _unreal and present_, we mark that by putting the verbs
in both the "if" and "then" clauses in the past tense.

| present (condition)  |   future |
|----------|----------|
|If my mother **had** wheels| she **would** be a bicycle.|

**Note:**  Never say "if I would." Just don't do it!

### Unreal Past

When the conditional is unreal and past, we move add the perfect aspect (eg had/would have) to the clauses.

|past|later past|
|----|-----------|
|If my great-great-grandmother **had had** wheels| She **would have been a bicycle|

## There's always an exception: 0-conditionals

0 conditionals describe simultaneaous events, so the "if" and "then" clauses are the same.

|present|also present|
|-----|--------------|
|when temperature increases,|pressure does too|
|If you see a tall guy,|that's probably my cousin Pete.
