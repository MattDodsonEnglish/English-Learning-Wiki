# Tense and Aspect

_Tense_<sup>[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense)</sup> is 
the time when an action occured.
_Aspect_<sup>[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect)</sup> is
how an action extends over time.

The tenses are the present, past, and the future. There are actually many ways
to add aspect to a sentence, but I'm going to focus on the two main aspects:
the perfect and the continuous.


## Tense

**prerequisites:** None. If you can read this sentence, you're good. However,
to accurately construct past tenses, you will need to [memorize](../tools.md#spaced-repition)
the irregular past forms[Â°](https://grammar.cl/Past/Irregular_Verbs_List.htm).

Really there are only two tenses in English: the present and the past. These
topics are probably pretty basic for most of my audience, so I'll go quickly.

This picture shows the dimension of time, devoid of all events:

The present refers to the time right now
