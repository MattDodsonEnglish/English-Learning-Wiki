# Tense and Aspect

*Tense*<sup>[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense)</sup> is 
the time when an action occured.
*Aspect*<sup>[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect)</sup> is
how an action extends over time.

The tenses are the present, past, and the future. There are actually many ways
to add aspect to a sentence, but I'm going to focus on the two main aspects:
the perfect and the continuous.


# Tense

**prerequisites:** None. If you can read this sentence, you're good. However,
to accurately construct past tenses, you will need to [memorize](../tools.md#spaced-repition)
the irregular past forms[°](https://grammar.cl/Past/Irregular_Verbs_List.htm).

## Tenses mark the present and the past

**Present simple**

Really there are only two tenses in English: the present and the past. These
topics are probably pretty basic for most of my audience, so I'll go quickly.

This picture shows the dimension of time, devoid of all events:

Although we think of the present as the "right now," in it's _simple_ form,
the present refers to things that are generally and permanently true.

> The horse eats grass.

What this sentence implies is a general truth about the horse's eating habits.
What it doesn't imply is whether the horse is eating at the moment.

There are two forms of the present: the verb "to be", and everything else.
Sentences with the verb "to be" differ from other sentences in three ways

* Their conjugation (see link here[°](https://www.thoughtco.com/present-and-past-forms-verb-be-1690359))
* Their negative form─negative sentences with regular verbs use `do not + $VERB` (e.g. #I do not know"in the negative structure`do/does + not + $VERB`;negative sentences with the verb "to be" uses only "not":
`I/you/it + am/are/is + not`
* Their interrogative form-questions with normal verbs begin with do("Do you know me");
questions with the verb "to be" begin with the verb itself ("Are you known?")

Because the present simple is the kernel around which all other sentences 
are constructed, getting these down is very important. The verb to be is doubly
important, as it's the basis of the continuous aspect. But before we get to that,
let's look at the past simple.

**Past simple**

As I said, the present simple is the kernel from which all structures grow. In
the case of the past, the structure's the exact same, just in the past.
However, while the present simple typically refers to a persistent event, the
past simple normally refers to an event that's finished in time. For example,
this even
